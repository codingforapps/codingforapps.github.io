							<h3>Begone Birds</h3>
							
							<p>Birds can be a real problem from pooping on cars to ruining gardens, or just being flat out annoying.Here are a couple ways to rid your backyard, garden, ect. of birds. These ways vary from capturing them or just doing a little planting to get rid of these pests.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Black birds ,a common bird are afraid of the color yellow so, planting yellow flowers in a backyard or garden should help.</li>
								<li>Setting traps is always an efficent way of getting rid of birds. (here's a link on how to catch them) <a href="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xREL1bkaOMM </a>
								<li>Starlings,another common bird are startled by mirrors and flashing lights so having those wouldn't hurt.</li>
								<li>Set up a small speaker that emits a sound of a bird that has spotted a predator when a motion senser is set up. </li>
								<li> Birds are highly aggravated by scented candles,the essential oils cause the birds nostrils and throat to be irritated.</li>
